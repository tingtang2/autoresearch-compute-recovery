## 🚀 Overview

**ML-Master 2.0** is a pioneering agentic science framework that tackles the challenge of ultra-long-horizon autonomy through cognitive accumulation, facilitated by a Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC) architecture that dynamically distills transient execution traces into stable long-term knowledge, ensuring that tactical execution and strategic planning remain decoupled yet co-evolve throughout complex, long-horizon scientific explorations.

> **Status**: ⌛ Initial code release is now available!

## 🚀 Overview

**ML-Master** is a novel AI4AI (AI-for-AI) agent that integrates exploration and reasoning into a coherent iterative methodology, facilitated by an adaptive memory mechanism that selectively captures and summarizes relevant insights and outcomes, ensuring each component mutually reinforces the other without compromising either. 

![ML-Master](./assets/ML-Master_figure.png)

## 📊 Performance Highlights

ML-Master outperforms prior baselines on the **[MLE-Bench](https://github.com/openai/mle-bench)**:

| Metric                      | Result                |
|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| 🥇 Average Medal Rate       | **29.3%**             |
| 🧠 Medium Task Medal Rate   | **20.2%**, more than doubling the previous SOTA            | 
| 🕒 Runtime Efficiency        | **12 hours**, 50% budget |

## 📆 Coming Soon

- [x] Grading report release
- [x] Paper release of ML-Master
- [x] Initial code release of ML-Master (expected early August)
- [x] Code refactoring for improved readability and maintainability

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🛠️ Environment Setup

#### Pull and Start Docker Container
Please execute the following commands to pull the latest image and start an interactive container:

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull sjtuagents/ml-master:latest

# Start the container
docker run --rm --gpus all --ipc=host --shm-size=64g \
  --runtime=nvidia --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 \
  -it sjtuagents/ml-master:latest /bin/bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sjtu-sai-agents/ML-Master.git
cd ML-Master
conda activate ml-master
```

#### Install ml-master
To get started, make sure to first install the environment of **[MLE-Bench](https://github.com/openai/mle-bench)**. After that, install additional packages based on `requirements.txt`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sjtu-sai-agents/ML-Master.git
cd ML-Master
conda create -n ml-master python=3.12
conda activate ml-master

# 🔧 Install MLE-Bench environment here
# (Follow the instructions in its README)

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 📦 Download MLE-Bench Data

The full MLE-Bench dataset is over **2TB**. We recommend downloading and preparing the dataset using the scripts and instructions provided by **[MLE-Bench](https://github.com/openai/mle-bench)**.

Once prepared, the expected dataset structure looks like this:

```
/path/to/mle-bench/plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7/
└── prepared
    ├── private
    │   └── test.csv
    └── public
        ├── description.md
        ├── images/
        ├── sample_submission.csv
        ├── test.csv
        └── train.csv
```

> 🪄 ML-Master uses symbolic links to access the dataset. You can download the data to your preferred location and ML-Master will link it accordingly.

---

### 🧠 Configure DeepSeek and GPT

ML-Master requires LLMs to return custom `<think></think>` tags in the response. Ensure your **DeepSeek** API supports this and follows the `OpenAI` client interface below:

```python
self.client = OpenAI(
    api_key=self.api_key,
    base_url=self.base_url
)
response = self.client.completions.create(**params)
```
If your API does not support this interface or you are using a closed source model(e.g. gpt-5) as coding model, please add `agent.steerable_reasoning=false` to `run.sh`. This may result in some performance loss.

Set your `base_url` and `api_key` in the `run.sh` script.
**GPT-4o** is used *only* for evaluation and feedback, consistent with **[MLE-Bench](https://github.com/openai/mle-bench)**.

```bash
# Basic configuration
AGENT_DIR=./
EXP_ID=plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7   # Competition name
dataset_dir=/path/to/mle-bench      # Path to prepared dataset
MEMORY_INDEX=0                      # GPU device ID

# DeepSeek config
code_model=deepseek-r1
code_temp=0.5
code_base_url="your_base_url"
code_api_key="your_api_key"

# GPT config (used for feedback & metrics)
feedback_model=gpt-4o-2024-08-06
feedback_temp=0.5
feedback_base_url="your_base_url"
feedback_api_key="your_api_key"

# CPU allocation
start_cpu=0
CPUS_PER_TASK=36
end_cpu=$((start_cpu + CPUS_PER_TASK - 1))

# Time limit (in seconds)
TIME_LIMIT_SECS=43200
```

---

### ▶️ Start Running
Before running ML-Master, you need to launch a server which tells agent whether the submission is valid or not, allowed and used by MLE-Bench.
```bash
bash launch_server.sh
```

After that, simply run the following command:

```bash
bash run.sh
```

📝 Logs and solutions will be saved in:

* `./logs` (for logs)
* `./workspaces` (for generated solutions)

---
### 🧪 Running in this repo (batch runner + environment overrides)

In this repository the launch scripts are parameterized so they run without editing hardcoded paths. Both `run.sh` (single run) and `run_batch_parallel.sh` (parallel batch) honor these environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATASET_DIR` | `$HOME/.cache/mle-bench/data` | Prepared MLE-bench data |
| `TIME_LIMIT_SECS` | `7200` (2 h) | Wall-clock budget per run — e.g. `300` for a smoke test, `43200` for 12 h |
| `ML_MASTER_DIR` | this agent directory | ML-Master checkout (used by the batch runner) |
| `MLEBENCH_DIR` | `<repo-root>/mle-bench` | mle-bench checkout, used for `mlebench prepare` (batch runner) |
| `CLEAN_WORKSPACES` | `0` | Set to `1` to wipe previous `workspaces/run` + `logs/run` before a batch |

```bash
# Single competition (defaults shown):
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
bash run.sh spaceship-titanic 42

# Parallel batch over a split file, 3 seeds, 12 workers:
DATASET_DIR=/data/mle-bench \
bash run_batch_parallel.sh "$MLEBENCH_DIR/experiments/splits/dev.txt" 3 12
```

> **Note:** `run_batch_parallel.sh` no longer deletes prior run output by default. Pass `CLEAN_WORKSPACES=1` explicitly if you want a clean slate.
